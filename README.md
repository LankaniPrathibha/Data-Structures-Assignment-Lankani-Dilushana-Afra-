# Singly Linked List Implementation

This project implements a Singly Linked List in Java. The list supports various operations including adding, removing, searching, and traversing nodes. It is designed to demonstrate the basic functionalities of a linked list data structure.

## Features

- Add nodes to the beginning, end, or at a specific position in the list.
- Remove nodes by value or by position.
- Search for an element in the list and retrieve its position.
- Traverse the list and display all elements.
- Reverse the order of nodes in the list.

## Classes

1. Node: Represents a single node in the linked list, containing data and a reference to the next node.
   
2. SinglyLinkedList: Contains methods to manipulate the linked list (add, remove, search, traverse, reverse).

3. InputHandler: Provides a command-line interface for users to interact with the linked list, allowing them to input commands to perform various operations.

## Requirements

To run this code, you need:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine. (Version 8 or above recommended)


## Usage

#commands

addFirst <value>: Adds a node with the specified value to the beginning of the list.
addLast <value>: Adds a node with the specified value to the end of the list.
addAt <value> <position>: Adds a node with the specified value at the given position.
removeValue <value>: Removes the first occurrence of the node with the specified value.
removePos <position>: Removes the node at the specified position.
traverse: Displays the contents of the list.
search <value>: Searches for the specified value and returns its position.
reverse: Reverses the order of the nodes in the list.
exit: Exits the program.
